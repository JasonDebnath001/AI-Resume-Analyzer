This project leverages **Puter.js** to provide robust client-side file system utilities, enabling seamless file manipulation, reading, and writing directly in the browser. Puter.js enhances the resume upload and processing experience by:

- Allowing efficient parsing and handling of PDF files before server upload.
- Improving compatibility and performance for file operations across browsers.
- Enabling advanced features such as drag-and-drop and in-browser file previews.
- Supporting static deployment and hosting of the application using Puter.js, making it easy to serve the app in serverless and browser-based environments.

For more information, see the [Puter.js documentation](https://github.com/ericvicenti/puter.js).
